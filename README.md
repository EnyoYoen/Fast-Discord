This project is really huge and requires a lot of time so any help is welcome, from the smallest syntax correction to major changes.
## Origins
The two main reasons that pushed me to create this project are: portability and client performance.
One day I wanted to install Discord on a Raspberry Pi, but I was running Ubuntu with an ARM processor, and Discord doesn't provide a version for computers running Linux and ARM processors.
And Discord is an application created with the Electron.js framework, so it uses a lot of resources, which is a shame for an application that you use in parallel with other applications most of the time.
## Coding Conventions
If you want to contribute to this project, you must respect the coding conventions from Qt (https://wiki.qt.io/Coding_Conventions).
